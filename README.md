# Mile Stone Project Four. 
## By Rusne Supronaite.
## UX

In this project i have created an online cookbook.

## Features 

My online cookbook allows users to view various recipes online without demending on the occasion.
With photos to match it makes it easy to find the recipe you want.
The front page will display to most populare recipes and at the bottom of the page there is 
collage that I have personally made from various photos of different types of food.

I the theme I have used is easy on the eyes and allows the focous to remain on the main point of the 
page. 

## Technogolgies used


1. JQuery
2.Flask
3.Python
4.Materializecss
5.HTML

## Testing
  
 The project itself was tested through chrome on different devices such as laptops, desktops and iPads. I also used the 
developer tools to see how things would look on smaller screen.
